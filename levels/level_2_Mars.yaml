intro: >
  You are starting a new life on Mars. Humans are terra-forming it, but the cities on Mars still need
  to be protected by domes. Fresh crops grown in the Martian greenhouses complement the supplies imported from Earth and
  other planets. Some (edible?) life forms are even beginning to cover the rocky surface outside of the domes.
  Your diner is located in a small city close to Pavonis Mons. Most of the settlers
  seeking their fortunes on Mars are humans, but there are also reptiloids and bovids. Make sure that they all
  feel at home in your diner! Your goal is to get 10 very positive reviews from each group.
  This will help you to establish a reputation as a versatile chef.
outro: >
  You did it! You have proven that you are a versatile chef with knowledge about a variety of cuisines.
  Your diner is booming. But you should dream big: this solar system is not the only one.
  Exciting culinary things are happening all around the galaxy...

      - Ah, I am a little bit bored today. Nothing to do.
      - Ah, what a day. So sandy and stormy.
      - Mh, my grandchildren drew a picture of me. Do you want to see it? Here it is. The number of horns is not quite right.
      - Ah, I need to remember to water the grass in my apartment.
      - How are you doing? I always talk about myself, I apologize.

        - meeting: >
            Your regular customer Aab invites you to the park. When you arrive, she is watching a game of
            Rubarch that two elderly humans are playing. Aab is one of the few non-human older citizens of Mars.
            Most of the new colonists that are arriving are young, and the first colonists that have grown old were
            from Earth. Aab greets you and invites you to take a seat with her at one
            of the small tables with game boards on them. You have a vague idea how Rubarch is played, and you start
            moving the spiky spheres around on the board. You quickly notice that Aab is not very good at it, either.
          question: >
            Ah, I like my friends here, but sometimes our activities bore me. I do not enjoy games that much.
            Mh, sometimes I wish I had a more challenging occupation... I used to be the director of a museum once.
          replies:
            - reply: I wish I had as much free time as you do. It's great to just hang out and relax all day.
              reaction: Mh, I hear you. But still, Rubarch every day... I worry that I will never get the hang of it.
            - reply: Well, couldn't you look for a job, or join an organization or something?
              reaction: Mh, I am not sure I can do it. I have lived for a long time and I have many horns...

                Ah, I have told all my friends about your diner. Perhaps they will try it out, and there will be
                an old person in your diner from time to time.
        - meeting: >
            Aab invites you to drink tea in the evening. You meet in her little apartment. Even though the
            furniture is optimized for bovid anatomy and the floor is covered with soil and grass instead of a carpet,
            the interior design uncannily reminds you of your own grandparents' style. Sipping
            the bitter herbal tea, you let your eyes wander over the shelves filled with tableware and souvenirs. There
            is also a cabinet filled with what looks like bovid horns, in various colors and lengths. Some of them are
            longer than you are tall.
          question: >
              Ah, impressive collection, do you not think? These are from friends and relatives. Sometimes old
              bovids decide to cut off their many horns as a symbol of starting anew, even if it is late in life.
              Mh, my uncle Esk traveled to another star for the first time when he was my age. My friend Oudge went back
              to the university. It is a custom to give away the horns as special gifts.
          replies:
            - reply: What a beautiful custom.
              reaction: Ah, yes. I often chew on the idea of doing this as well. But I do not know if I have the courage.
            - reply: Uh... seems a little weird to me.
              reaction: >
                Ah, perhaps from the outside it looks a little distressing. To me, it is a beautiful thing.

        - meeting: You visit Aab again in her apartment. This time, Aab serves some snacks with the tea. You chew on
            the small blocks of pressed plants while Aab tells you about her family. 'Ah, it has been ten years now
            that we left our home system that you call Barnard's Star. Mh, I miss the meadows... When I lived there,
            I could just leave my house and have some fresh grass and herbs any time.'
          question: Ah, they are now starting to grow some plants on the surface of Mars. What do you think about this?
          replies:
            - reply: It's wonderful. The planet is coming to life.
              reaction: Mh, you are right. It will take a long time until I can go out and graze in a Martian meadow,
                but it is a promising start.
            - reply: I am against it. The red rocks make this planet unique.
              reaction: Ah, I see, you want to preserve what makes Mars special. Mh, but think about the advantages,
                hornless friend. More fresh products for us to eat and to cook with.

                Here you go, I will give you the address of a nice little market stand where you can buy them.
                Ah, you are most welcome.
        - meeting: Aab invites you for a walk on the Bright Boulevard with her and two of her grandchildren.
            The Bright Boulevard is a promenade that leads around the city, right next to the inner side of the dome.
            The boulevard is swarming with citizens, most of them families and joggers. Once a year, a city marathon
            takes place on this trail. It takes a human jogger around 4 hours to complete the whole round.
            With Aab and the kids, you walk only a small fraction of it, and you stop from time to time to rest on
            one of the many benches facing the outer wall. The children press their nose against the transparent panes
            that form the walls of the dome. Aab points out some colorful patches of lichen and moss on the rocks
            to them and explains what kinds they are.
          question: Ah, I have even more little hornless grandchildren, you know. Mh, but some of them are growing up in
            in other solar systems, and I have never been there in person.
          replies:
            - reply: You can visit them if you want.
              reaction: Mh, you are right, but interstellar traveling is exhausting, and I am not young anymore.
                But it would be delightful to see more worlds...
            - reply: I am sure your grandchildren here on Mars are happy to have you around.
              reaction: Ah, yes, you are right. Still, the thought of seeing new worlds tingles me in my stomachs...

                things up quite a bit! It will be lovely.
        - meeting: You visit Aab again in her apartment. You notice that the living lawn-carpet looks different
            than last time, some of the grasses and herbs are flowering. Aab tells you that you are welcome to pick
            some of them and snack them if you want. You try a small yellow flower. It tastes very bitter, but
            somehow enjoyable. Aab is standing in the kitchenette and stirring a bit pot. As far as you know,
            it is rare for bovids to cook a hot meal, but whatever is in the pot is clearly simmering and steaming.
            It smells good. You recognize the spiciness of Martian plants, but when Aab starts frying something in a
            pan, a familiar Earth scent starts to fill the room.
          question: Ah, here you go. I hope you like it. What do you think about bovid cuisine?
          replies:
            - reply: I love fresh greens.
              reaction: Ah, how nice. This recipe here is not so typical, there is nothing raw in it.
                But I like to make things warm and soft sometimes.
            - reply: I'm more the meat-and-potato kind of person.
              reaction: Ah, this sounds interesting as well. I cannot digest meat, but perhaps you can cook
                this 'potato' for me some time.

                with the moss that grows in my home region, but it works with Martian products as well. Please put
                it on the menu in your diner. Ah, I am sure it is going to be a big hit.
        - meeting: You agreed to meet Aab in your diner in the evening. You are polishing the silverware when an
           unfamiliar bovid appears at the door. It takes you a few seconds to recognize that it is Aab – but without
           her horns.
          question: Ah, my young friend, you look surprised. I have decided to go for it. I am old, but I want to see
            new world. Tomorrow, I am leaving for the Tau-Ceti system. Some of my grandchildren live there, and I also
            have some reptiloid friends that I want to visit. Ah, I came to say good-bye.
          replies:
            - reply: Wow! I wish you the best of luck on your adventure.
              reaction: Ah, thank you, my friend. I hope I will eat in your diner again some day.
            - reply: I am worried. Interstellar journeys are dangerous and exhausting.
              reaction: Mh, do not worry, my young friend. I know that I can do it. The hardest part was
                 summoning my courage, and I have succeeded.

      - I am glad that it is getting a bit warmer. Makes it much easier for the cold-blooded among us.

      - Sigh. My hornless children are really exhausting.
      - Ah, my stomachs hurt. Or at least one of them hurts, sometimes it's hard to tell.
      - I heard that they want to allow keeping pets inside the domes soon. I'd really like one of these Earth dogs.
      - I got a nice compliment about my horns today. It really lifted my spirit.
      - I received a message from my cousins in Barnard's Star system. It is always so nice to hear from them!

      - I'm just going to rest my eyes for a minute.
      - You should print your menu in bigger letters. I can barely read it.
      - What kind of music are these kids outside listening to? Sounds like a lot of noise to me.
      - I wish I still had all my teeth. You should take good care of your teeth while you are young!
      - I feel tired today. Sigh.
      - My children gave me this new walking stick. Isn't it nice?
      - What did you say? Sorry, I can't hear so well.

      - Ugh. I am trying to do my homework, but I understand nothing. Isn't algebra the worst?
      - I wish I could spent more time outside the dome. They should speed up this atmosphere thing.
      - Do you like being a chef? Doesn't look like fun.
