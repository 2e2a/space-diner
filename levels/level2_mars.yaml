intro: >
  You are starting a new life on Mars. Humans are terra-forming it, but the cities on Mars still need
  to be protected by domes. Fresh crops grown in the Martian greenhouses complement the supplies imported from Earth and
  other planets. Some (edible?) life forms are even beginning to cover the rocky surface outside of the domes.
  Your diner is located in a small city close to Pavonis Mons. Most of the settlers
  seeking their fortunes on Mars are humans, but there are also reptiloids and bovids. Make sure that they all
  feel at home in your diner! Your goal is to get 25 positive reviews from each group. This will help you to establish
  a reputation as a versatile chef.

      meetings:
        - meeting: Aab invites you to drink tea in the evening. You meet in her little appartment. Even though the furniture is 
            optimized for bovid anatomy and the floor is covered with soil and grass instead of a carpet,
            the interior design uncannily reminds you of your own grandparents' style. Sipping
            the bitter herbal tea, you let your eyes wander over the shelves filled with tableware and souvenirs. There is
            also a cabinet filled with what looks like bovid horns, in various colors and lengths. Some of them are longer than
            you are tall.
          question: Ah, you see, I have many horns, but I used to have even more. It is a custom to keep the ones that fell out.
            Impressive collection, do you not think?
          replies:
            - reply: Wow, these are all yours?
              reaction: Oh, most of them yes, but sometimes my relatives also send me one as a personal gift.
            - reply: Eh, I have seen better.
              reaction: Oh, yes, some bovids have downright museums of impressive horns that humble me and my modest collection.

              decoration: twisted horn
              text: The horns can be quite decorative, do you not think? Here, you can have one for your empty wall in your pretty diner.
        - meeting: You visit Aab again in her apartment. This time, Aab serves some snacks with the tea. You chew on
            the small blocks of pressed plants while Aab tells you about her family. 'Ah, it has been ten years now
            that we left our home system that you call Barnard's Star. My children with fewer horns visit our home
            planet sometimes, but I am too tired for interstellar traveling, I think. Mh, but I miss the meadows...
            When I lived there, I could just leave my house and have some fresh grass and herbs any time.'
          question: Ah, they are now starting to grow some plants on the surface of Mars. What do you think about this?
          replies:
            - reply: It's wonderful. The planet is coming to life.
              reaction: Mh, you are right. It will take a long time until I can go out and graze in a Martian meadow,
                but it is a promising start.
            - reply: I am against it. The red rocks make this planet unique.
              reaction: Ah, I see, you want to preserve what makes Mars special. Mh, but think about the advantages,
                hornless friend. More fresh products for us to eat and to cook with.
          rewards:

              text: Mh, it would be wonderful if I could order some of the new Martian plants in your diner.
                Here you go, I will give you the address of a nice little market stand where you can buy them.
                Ah, you are most welcome.
        - meeting: Aab invites you for a walk on the Bright Boulevard with her and two of her grandchildren.
            The Bright Boulevard is a promenade that leads around the city, right next to the inner side of the dome.
            The boulevard is swarming with citizens, most of them families and joggers. Once a year, a city marathon
            takes place on this trail. It takes a human jogger around 4 hours to complete the whole round.
            With Aab and the kids, you walk only a small fraction of it, and you stop from time to time to rest on
            one of the many benches facing the outer wall. The children press their nose against the transparent panes
            that form the walls of the dome. Aab points out some colorful patches of lichen and moss on the rocks
            to them and explains what kinds they are.
          question: I wonder if the kids will walk around out there without spacesuits some day. What do you think?
          replies:
            - reply: I don't think so. Terraforming takes a long time.
              reaction: Mh, you are right, we must be patient. But still, I have a glimmer of hope that
                they might experience that...
            - reply: I hope so. Technological progress is speeding up, perhaps it will go faster than expected.
              reaction: Ah, that would be wonderful. Imagine how the fresh Martian grass would feel under their
                bare hooves...

              text: I am going to tell all my grandchildren and their friends about your diner. This should liven
              things up quite a bit! It will be lovely.
        - meeting: You visit Aab again in her apartment. You notice that the living lawn-carpet looks different
            than last time, some of the grasses and herbs are flowering. Aab tells you that you are welcome to pick
            some of them and snack them if you want. You try a small yellow flower. It tastes very bitter, but
            somehow enjoyable. Aab is standing in the kitchenette and stirring a bit pot. As far as you know,
            it is rare for bovids to cook a hot meal, but whatever is in the pot is clearly simmering and steaming.
            It smells good. You recognize the spiciness of Martian plants, but when Aab starts frying something in a
            pan, a familiar Earth scent starts to fill the room.
          question: Ah, here you go. I hope you like it. What do you think about bovid cuisine?
          replies:
            - reply: I love fresh greens.
              reaction: Ah, how nice. This recipe here is not so typical, there is nothing raw in it.
              But I like to make things warm and soft sometimes.
            - reply: I'm more the meat-and-potato kind of person.
              reaction: Ah, this sounds interesting as well. I cannot digest meat, but perhaps you can cook
                these 'potatoes' for me some time.

              recipe: Aab's Moss Soup
              text: Here, I will write down the recipe for you. It is an old family. Mh, it is best
                with the moss that grows in my home region, but it works with Martian products as well. Please put
                it on the menu in your diner. Ah, I am sure it is going to be a big hit.
