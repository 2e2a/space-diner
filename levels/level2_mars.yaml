intro: >
  You are starting a new life on Mars. Humans are terra-forming it, but the cities on Mars still need
  to be protected by domes. Fresh crops grown in the Martian greenhouses complement the supplies imported from Earth and
  other planets. Some (edible?) life forms are even beginning to cover the rocky surface outside of the domes.
  Your diner is located in a small city close to Pavonis Mons. Most of the settlers
  seeking their fortunes on Mars are humans, but there are also reptiloids and bovids. Make sure that they all
  feel at home in your diner! Your goal is to get 25 positive reviews from each group. This will help you to establish
  a reputation as a versatile chef.
