      - Your food is always so comforting.
      - Last week, I tried to eat at the other diner. It's just not the same.
      - Sometimes I feel like nothing new is ever happening in the colony anymore. Sigh.
      - Hey, did you change the color of the curtains? I like it.

            Sam invites you to the "Crater". It is the oldest bar in the colony. Like every night, it is
            pretty crowded. Sam seems to know every single person here. You recognize some people who sometimes
            eat at your diner. You find two seats at a small table. Sam orders two beers for you.
          question: Today is my Moon anniversary. I arrived here exactly 20 years ago. Can you imagine? Sigh.
          good replies:
            - reply: Wow, 20 years. I'm sure it hasn't always been easy.
              reaction: >
                Yes, life in the colony can be hard. I feel old. Perhaps I should have moved away a long time ago.
                Sigh. But it helps that you always listen to me and my complaints.
          bad replies:
            - reply: Why are you so depressed about it? That's something to celebrate!
              reaction: >
               No... It makes me feel old. Perhaps I should have moved away a long time ago.
               But now it's too late. Sigh.
        - meeting: >
            Sam wants to walk around in the large Moon Mall. Your diner is also in the mall. When you walk past it,
            Sam remembers something.
          question: >
            I met my friend Muriel yesterday. She has a new business. You know these little worms that live on the
            dark side? Silkworms? She is breeding and selling them. Apparently all those tourists that are coming to
            the Moon are crazy about silkworms. Maybe you could put them in your burgers, the tourists would love that.
            I should introduce you to Muriel some day.
          good replies:
            - reply: Sure, why not, I guess I could try that.
              reaction: Great! I will introduce you to Muriel once I know you a little better.
          bad replies:
            - reply: Worms? Disgusting.
          reaction: >
            You're right, but think about it, they could make you rich.
            I will introduce you to Muriel anyway... a bit later.

      - There are more and more tourists from Earth. I hate them.
      - All my friends are moving away. Noone wants to stay in this colony.
      - I hope I can move to one of those fancy new apartments soon.
      - The stars are beautiful today.
      - I lifted 1000 kg in the gym today.
      - Your furniture is not very comfortable.
      - I hate the new Armstrong Museum. The idiots stand in line for hours just for a foot print.
      - I wonder what is going on on Earth. I haven't been there for 8 years.
      - The next ship from Earth will arrive tomorrow.
      - My brother moved to Mars. I hope I can visit him soon.

      - It is wonderful to visit all these little local business here.
      - Did you hear? They are building a Moon amusement park. Amazing!
      - I love the low gravity here. I could jump around all day.
      - I cannot get enough of seeing Earth from here. It is so small! Can you believe it?
      - I cannot wait to tell all my friends on Earth about my Moon adventures.
      - I am so excited. Can I take a picture of this diner? I already did. Thank you!
      - I love the new Armstrong Museum. The foot print is amazing.
      - I love it here on the Moon! ...maybe it could just be a little bit warmer.
      - Everything is so exotic here, I love it.
      - I am returning to Earth tomorrow. What a shame! I would love to stay a bit longer.
