intro: >
  The moon has been colonized. There are a couple of settlements, mainly on the bright side of the moon.
  You run a diner in one of them. It is not very lucrative, but you have a solid customer base, because
  there are not many alternatives within the colony. Try to earn 1000 space dollars - that's the amount
  you need to buy an interplanetary ticket and open a diner in a more interesting place.

            Ozabela invites you to the research facility where she works. Access to the area is restricted, but when
            the security guards see Ozabela, they let you enter. Ozabela shows you what she is currently working on
            in her lab: silkworms. A couple of them were brought to the Dark Side of the moon a long time ago in a
            box as part of a research project. The project was abandoned, but the silkworms infested some of the
            research facilities and somehow managed to survive there until today.
            Ozabela's team collects them and studies how they have adapted to life on the moon. As you look
            at them through the terrarium glass, you remember another time when you encountered this species: as an
            appetizer in an expensive restaurant on the Dark Side.
          question: Just look at them... how they wriggle...
          good replies:
            - reply: They're fascinating.
              reaction: >
                Yes, they are. It is incredible that they are able to survive out there. We are still not sure how
                they do it.

            - reply: They're disgusting.

                Well, not everyone is able to appreciate their beauty.

            Ozabela wants to walk around the underground mall. There are about 20 businesses in the mall, including
            your diner. Only some of them are open at night: the bar, the cinema, and a fancy new restaurant. Plenty of
            people are just walking around like you - there is only so much you can do in the evening in the colony.
            When you walk past your diner, Ozabela stops.
          question: So, what brought you here - to the moon?
          good replies:
            - reply: My goal is to see as much as I can of our galaxy. My first step was to leave Earth and come here.
              reaction: I admire that. Send me postcards from all the other place you'll get to see!
            - reply: I just rolled with the flow.
              reaction: Fair enough. I wonder where you'll roll next.
          bad replies:
            - reply: Nothing in particular. I don't really care where I work.
              reaction: That's a pity. I like to hear about people's dreams and motivations.
        - meeting: >
            You meet Ozabela at The Lunatic, the first bar that ever opened on the moon. It is not located in the underground
            mall, but in an older structure on the surface. It is officially recommended not to spend more than five hours
            there, because radiation protection is less perfect there than in the underground parts of the colony. Nevertheless,
            it is crowded, like every evening. You find a free table in the back. Ozabela orders two beers. She tells you a bit about
            her day: a new experiment that they conducted failed in some way, but you only understand every other word.
            She stops and looks around at the other people in the bar. You know every single person who is there, and
            you are sure that Ozabela does, too. The colony is small.
          question: Do you ever think about leaving the moon?
          good replies:
            - reply: I'm saving money to leave as soon as possible.
              reaction: That's brave. I'm thinking about it, too, but I'm not sure I have it in me to quit and leave.
            - reply: No, I like the colony.
              reaction: I like it, too, but do you not feel trapped sometimes? I'm not so sure myself...
          bad replies:
            - reply: I'm not sure.
              reaction: Me neither. It is a hard decision... I wish I was more decisive.
        - meeting: >
            Ozabela wants to see a movie. There is a brand-new cinema in the amusement park that they finished building
            this year. However, you decide to go to the one in the mall. There are only 12 seats there. Most of them
            are already taken when you enter, and you have to sit in the first row right in front of the screen. You 
            watch a documentary about creatures living in the ocean on Earth. After the movie, Ozabela looks depressed.
          question: So full of life. Earth, I mean. And we only have our little worms. There's nothing else.
          good replies:
            - reply: Yes, but they're really interesting worms.
              reaction: >
                Ha, you're right. There's easily a lifetime's worth of research in just this one species that we have here.
          bad replies:
            - reply: Cheer up. Less species means less work for you biologists.
            - reaction: Not really. The work is just more repetitive.
        - meeting: >
            Silkworms have been spotted in an abandoned lab in the vicinity of the colony by a tourist guide.
            Ozabela invites you to join her in counting, examining, and documenting them. It is so close that you don't
            have to take one of the rovers - you can walk. You are not used to wearing a spacesuit and you stumble along
            slowly and clumsily. Ozabela does not seem to mind. You finally arrive at the lab, where you find a cluster
            of cocoons. While she scans them, Ozabela tells you something about the mutations that they have undergone.
            "Only a few of them will make it out of the cocoons", you hear Ozabela say through the audio system
            integrated in your helmet. Her voice sounds metallic. "They become silkmoths, but they do not fly here.
            Instead, they use strange low-gravity twitches to move."
            When you are done with the scanning and counting, Ozabela puts two of the 24 cocoons in a small cylinder.
            Outside, she looks up to Earth, hanging in the sky above you.
          question: Do you miss it? The Earth? Its gravity? Its people?
          good replies:
            - reply: I think about it all the time.
              reaction: Yes, it is not easy to forget. Look at it... I miss it sometimes.
            - reply: No, I don't like to look back.
              reaction: You're right. We should be looking forward. But what if moving forward means returning to Earth?
          bad replies:
            - reply: I don't like questions like that.
              reaction: Why? It's important to think about the past... and the future.
        - meeting: >
           Ozabela comes to the empty diner in the evening. You cook beef burgers with pickles just for the two of you.
           "I have to tell you something", she says after finishing the burger. "I was offered a professorship at the
           University of Tokyo. On Earth."
          good replies:
            - reply: Congratulations. Sounds like a great opportunity.

                Thank you. I will accept it. I am going to miss your food and your company... Please stay in touch with
                me, will you?
            - reply: I think you should stay here. You are so enthusiastic about your research on the moon.
              reaction: >
                I am, but I think it's time for me to move on. I am going to miss your food and your company...

      - I cannot wait to tell all my friends on Earth about my Moon adventures.
      - I love the Armstrong Museum. I could look at that foot print all day.
      - I love it here on the Moon! ...maybe it could just be a little bit warmer.
      - Oh, look at all those wondrous local people!
      - I am returning to Earth tomorrow. What a shame! I would love to stay longer.
