      - question: Today is my Moon anniversary. I arrived here exactly 20 years ago. Can you imagine? Sigh.
        good replies:
          - reply: Wow, 20 years. I'm sure it hasn't always been easy.
        reaction: >
          Yes, life in the colony can be hard. I feel old. Perhaps I should have moved away a long time ago.
          Sigh. But it helps that you always listen to me and my complaints.
        bad replies:
      - reply: Why are you so depressed about it? That's something to celebrate!
        reaction: >
          No... It makes me feel old. Perhaps I should have moved away a long time ago.
          But now it's too late. Sigh.
      - question: >
          I met my friend Muriel yesterday. She has a new business. You know these little worms that live on the
          dark side? Silkworms? She is breeding and selling them. Apparently all those tourists that are coming to
          the Moon are crazy about silkworms. Maybe you could put them in your burgers, the tourists would love that.
          I should introduce you to Muriel some day.
        good replies:
          - reply: Sure, why not, I guess I could try that.
            reaction: Great! I will introduce you to Muriel once I know you a little better.
        bad replies:
          - reply: Worms? Disgusting.
        reaction: >
          You're right, but think about it, they could make you rich.
          I will introduce you to Muriel anyway... a bit later.
