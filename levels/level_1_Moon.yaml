name: Moon

intro: The moon has been colonized. You run a diner in one of the settlements.
  It is not very lucrative, but you have a solid customer base.
  The colony is too insignificant to have visitors from other
  planets or even solar systems, but it is a quite popular spot for human tourists from Earth.
  Try to earn 500 space dollars - that's the amount you need to buy an interplanetary ticket and open a diner
  in a more interesting place.

            the security guards see Ozabela, they let you enter. Ozabela shows you what she is working on
            in her lab: silkworms. A couple of them were brought to the far side of the moon a long time ago in a
            box as part of a research project. The project was abandoned, but the silkworms infested some of the
            research facilities and somehow managed to survive there until today.
            Ozabela''s team collects them and studies how they have adapted to life on the moon.
            There''s a large plastic model of one and a terrarium with live specimen. As you look
            at them through the terrarium glass, you remember another time when you encountered this species: as an
            appetizer in an expensive restaurant on the dark side.'

          replies:
            - reply: They're fascinating.
              reaction: Yes, they are. It is incredible that they are able to survive out there. We are still not sure how
                they do it.

        - meeting: 'You meet Ozabela at The Lunatic, the first bar that ever opened on the moon.
            It is not located in the underground mall, but in an older structure on the surface. It is officially recommended not to spend more than five hours
            there, because radiation protection is less perfect there than in the underground parts of the colony. Nevertheless,
            it is crowded, like every evening. You find a free table in the back. Ozabela orders two beers. She tells you a bit about
            her day: a new experiment that they conducted failed in some way, but you only understand every other word.
            She stops and looks around at the other people in the bar. You know every single person who is there, and
            you are sure that Ozabela does, too. The colony is small.'
          question: Do you ever think about leaving the moon?
          replies:
            - reply: I'm saving money to leave as soon as possible.
              reaction: That's brave. I'm thinking about it, too, but I'm not sure I have it in me to quit and leave.
            - reply: No, I like the colony.
              reaction: I like it, too, but do you not feel trapped sometimes? I'm not so sure myself...
            - reply: I'm not sure.

        - meeting: Ozabela wants to see a movie. There is a brand-new cinema in the amusement park that they finished building
            this year. However, you decide to go to the cinema in the mall. There are only 12 seats there. Most of them
            are already taken when you enter, and you have to sit in the first row right in front of the screen. You 
            watch a documentary about creatures living in the ocean on Earth. After the movie, Ozabela looks depressed.
          question: So full of life. Earth, I mean. And we only have our little worms. There's nothing else.
          replies:
            - reply: Yes, but they're really interesting worms.
              reaction: Ha, you're right. There's easily a lifetime's worth of research in just this one species that we have here.
            - reply: Cheer up. Less species means less work for you biologists.
            - reaction: Not really. The work is just more repetitive.

        - meeting: Silkworms have been spotted in an abandoned lab in the vicinity of the colony by a tourist guide.
            Ozabela invites you to join her in counting, examining, and documenting them. It is so close that you don't
            have to take one of the rovers - you can walk. You are not used to wearing a spacesuit and you stumble along
            slowly and clumsily. Ozabela does not seem to mind. You finally arrive at the lab, where you find a cluster
            of cocoons. While she scans them, Ozabela tells you something about the mutations that they have undergone.
            "Only a few of them will make it out of the cocoons", you hear Ozabela say through the audio system
            integrated in your helmet. Her voice sounds metallic. "They become silkmoths, but they do not fly here.
            Instead, they use strange low-gravity twitches to move."
            When you are done with the scanning and counting, Ozabela puts two of the 24 cocoons in a small cylinder.
            Outside, she looks up to Earth, hanging in the sky above you.
          question: Do you miss it? The Earth? Its gravity? Its people?
          replies:
            - reply: I think about it all the time.
              reaction: Yes, it is not easy to forget. Look at it... I miss it sometimes.
            - reply: No, I don't like to look back.
              reaction: You're right. We should be looking forward. But what if moving forward means returning to Earth?
            - reply: I don't like questions like that.
              reaction: Why? It's important to think about the past... and the future.

        - meeting: Ozabela comes to the empty diner in the evening. You cook beef burgers with pickles just for the two of you.
           "I have to tell you something", she says after finishing the burger. "I was offered a professorship at the
           University of Tokyo. On Earth."

      - Welcome to my humble shop,
    chats:
      - The worms are really fresh today, they have just been delivered!
      - Today's worms are a bit more matured, but I assure you they are still perfectly safe to eat.
